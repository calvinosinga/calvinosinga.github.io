						<h2>Comparing color to star formation activity</h2>

							A galaxy that qualifies as "red"
							is not necessarily
							always quiescent. <a href="rb_vs_sf/sf.html">
							We examine how different the color

						<h2>evolution of HI auto power</h2>
						<p>
							The redshift evolution of the HI auto power spectrum, shown as a ratio over 
							the z = 0 result. The contours are excluded for ease of reading.

							The auto power increases between redshifts 1 and 0.5, but decreases
							significantly between 0 and 0.5.

							This highlights that quenching galaxies play a large role in the
							evolution of structure in the HI distribution.

						<h2>evolution of galaxy auto powers</h2>
						<p>
							The redshift evolution of the blue (left), red (center),
							and all (right) galaxy auto powers. The galaxy
							auto power increases with time, which is the
							expected evolution for power spectra.

							However, the both of the colored auto powers decrease with time
							between the latter two snapshots. This is also seen in the
							cross-powers, but this removes the influence of the relationship
							between galaxy color and HI, at least directly.

									<h2>Online Figures</h2>
									<p>
										Here we present figures that were
										important to the analysis in this project,
										but were cut from the paper for brevity. 
										
										The paper still references these analyses,
										so they are included here. The figures are
										presented in the order they are referenced
										in the paper.

										The descriptions will assume you have read
										the paper, so they will not be necessarily
										approachable without first reading the text.
