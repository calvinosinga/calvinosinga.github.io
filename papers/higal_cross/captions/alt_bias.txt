Compares the observer bias (top) and theoretical bias (bot)
with respect to matter of blue and red galaxies and HI. The
dip feature analyzed in the paper deepens when using the 
bias more resistant to stochasticity. Additionally, the dip
feature develops in the blue galaxies at $z = 0$ and in the
HI bias at $z = 0.5$. The blue galaxies more strongly
cluster than HI, so they will resist the subtle effects
caused by galaxy quenching more effectively.
