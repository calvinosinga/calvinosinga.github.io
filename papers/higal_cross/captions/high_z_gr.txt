$g - r$ distribution for centrals, satellites
and all galaxies at $z = 2$. The bimodal
distribution is not present and does
not accurately reflect that seen in 
observations. Beyond that, only
having a few hundred halos with 
red galaxies may lead to shot noise
issues. Thus we do not extend our
analysis to redshifts beyond $z = 1$.
