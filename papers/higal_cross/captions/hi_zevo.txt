The redshift evolution of the HI auto
power spectrum, shown as a ratio over 
the z = 0 result. The contours are
excluded for ease of reading.
The auto power increases between
redshifts 1 and 0.5, but decreases
significantly between 0 and 0.5.

This highlights that quenching galaxies
play a large role in the evolution of
structure in the HI distribution.
