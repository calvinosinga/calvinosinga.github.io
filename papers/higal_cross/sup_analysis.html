						<h2>high redshift color distribution</h2>
						<p>
							Color distribution for
							galaxies at z = 2. The bimodal
							distribution is not clear and does
							not accurately reflect that seen in 
							observations (Whitaker+15, Kreik+15).
							Beyond that, only
							having a few hundred 
							red galaxies may lead to shot noise
							issues. Thus we do not extend our
							analysis to redshifts beyond z = 1.

						<h2>comparing color to star formation state</h2>
						<p style="font-size: medium;">
							Analyzes the differences between our definitions of red and 
							blue galaxies and star-forming and quiescent galaxies.
							Red galaxies are not necessarily quenched, as some
							active galaxies can appear red due to abundant
							dust. Donnari+19 separates galaxies into star-forming
							and quenched populations via lines in the
							(V-J) - (U-V) plane (see their figure 1). We represent a 
							galaxy's position in the UVJ plane as its distance
							to the threshold separating active and quenched galaxies (x-axis),
							where negative distances indicate quenched galaxies.
							The y-axis contains the fiducial g-r cuts 
							(which change with redshift) used in our analysis. Thresholds from both
							Donnari+19 and our analysis are represented with orange lines.
							<br><br>

							The 2D histograms show how the galaxy populations from z = 0 
							(green background) and z = 1 (brown background)
							fall into the UVJ and g - r planes. Galaxies in the upper left 
							quadrant are red and quenched, galaxies in the
							lower right are blue and star-forming. The other two quadrants are
							galaxies that color doesn't accurately identify.
							The effect of the misidentification is seen in the 1D 
							histograms along each axis. The panel above shows the UVJ
							distribution in white, and then the UVJ distribution of galaxies
							 we identified as red in red. The number of
							star-forming galaxies misidentified as red are negligible at both redshifts. 
							However, at z > 1 this is no
							longer the case (see Donnari+19). 
							The panels to the right of the 2D histograms show the g-r
							distributions for all galaxies (white) and quiescent galaxies (pink). 
							Again, galaxies we identify as blue
							that are quenched is negligible, so at the redshifts we 
							examine in our analysis the distinction between
							"red and blue" and "star-forming and quiescent" is negligible.

						<h2>Color evolution of centrals and satellites</h2>
						<p>
							Color-mass plane of galaxies at z = 0, 0.5, and 1 for centrals, satellites
							and both. The red line corresponds to the fiducial g-r
							cut made in the main paper for each redshift, where galaxies
							lying above the cut are red and below blue. <br><br>
							
							Red galaxies poorly occupy the regime around
							<span class="math inline">
								<em>M</em><sub>⋆</sub> = 10<sup>10</sup><em>M</em><sub>⊙</sub>
							</span>,
							particularly at z = 1. This regime starts to fill in as
							less massive centrals and more massive satellites quench at later redshifts.

						<h2>redshift-space power spectra with velocities projected along alternate axes</h2>
						<p>
							Galaxy auto powers in redshift space at z = 0,
							projecting velocities along different lines of sight.
							Each line of sight is plotted as a ratio over the 
							fiducial <em>x</em>-axis. It is not necessarily expected 
							that each line of sight gives similar power spectra, 
							as some axes will collapse faster than others 
							(Zel'dovich pancake). In any case, the auto powers
							change by a factor of about 1.3 on the largest
							scales, so the effect is not large.

						<h2>convergence of power spectra with grid resolution</h2>
						<p>
							Tests of the convergence of cross-powers with different grids.
							The grids lie directly on top of one another, thus we conclude
							that our results are converged.

									<h2>Online Figures</h2>
									<p>
										Here we present figures that were
										important to the analysis in this project,
										but were cut from the paper for brevity. 
										
										The paper still references these analyses,
										so they are included here. The figures are
										presented in the order they are referenced
										in the paper.

										The descriptions will assume you have read
										the paper, so they will not be necessarily
										approachable without first reading the text.
