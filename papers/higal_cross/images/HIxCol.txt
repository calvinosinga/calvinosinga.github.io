Cross-power spectra between HI and galaxies of different colors, split into centrals and satellites at $z = 0$.
There are some interesting trends; we start with the blue galaxies. At all stellar mass bins, blue satellites
cluster more with HI than centrals do. However, due to the small blue satellite fraction, blue centrals 
dominate the contribution to the cross-power spectrum at each bin. The all-galaxy cross-power spectra receive
significant contributions from both central and satellite galaxies in all stellar mass ranges, although the
centrals contribute more at higher stellar masses. Red satellites completely dominate the cross-power spectra
calculated using the smaller stellar mass ranges, as is seen by the proximity of the satellite-HI cross-power
spectrum to the one calculated using both centrals and satellites. Only in the highest stellar mass range
probed here, do we find that red centrals start contributing significantly to the HI-red cross-power spectrum.
