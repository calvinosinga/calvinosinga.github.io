Color distribution for galaxies
at $z$ = 2. The bimodal
distribution is not clear and
does not accurately reflect
that seen in observations 
(Whitaker+15, Kreik+15),
although this may be because of
selection biases. In any case,
only having a few hundred red
galaxies may lead to shot noise
issues. Thus we do not extend
our analysis to redshifts
beyond $z$ = 1.
