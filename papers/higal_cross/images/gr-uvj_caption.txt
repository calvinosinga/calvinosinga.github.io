Analyzes the differences between our definitions of red and blue galaxies and star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Red galaxies are not necessarily
quenched, as some active galaxies can appear red due to abundant dust. Donnari+19 separates galaxies into star-forming and quenched populations via
lines in the (V-J) - (U-V) plane (see their figure 1). We represent a galaxy's position in the UVJ plane as its distance to the threshold separating
active and quenched galaxies (x-axis), where negative distances indicate quenched galaxies. The y-axis contains the fiducial g-r cuts (which change 
with redshift) used in our analysis. Thresholds from both Donnari+19 and our analysis are represented with orange lines.

The 2D histograms show how the galaxy populations from z = 0 (green background) and z = 1 (brown background) fall into the UVJ and g - r planes.
Galaxies in the upper left quadrant are red and quenched, galaxies in the lower right are blue and star-forming. The other two quadrants are
galaxies that color doesn't accurately identify. The effect of the misidentification is seen in the 1D histograms along each axis. The panel above
shows the UVJ distribution in white, and then the UVJ distribution of galaxies we identified as red in red. The number of star-forming galaxies
misidentified as red are negligible at both redshifts. However, at z > 1 this is no longer the case (see Donnari+19). The panels to the right of the
2D histograms show the g-r sistributions for all galaxies (white) and quiescent galaxies (pink). Again, galaxies we identify as blue that are 
quenched is negligible, so at the redshifts we examine in our analysis the distinction between "red and blue" and "star-forming and quiescent" is
negligible.
