The auto power spectra of galaxies within a particular HI bin, as a function of redshift. Interestingly, galaxies in 
the largest HI mass bin are the only ones that cluster less with time - the other two bins have negligible changes in
their clustering with time. This suggests that the baryonic effects that cause the inverted redshift evolution of the
clustering of HI occurs largely in galaxies with HI masses $\geq 10^9 M_\odot$.
