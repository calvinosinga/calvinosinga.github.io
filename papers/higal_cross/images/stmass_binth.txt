Similar to Fig. 8 from original paper, but for $z = 0.5$. We do not complete the same analysis at $z = 1$ due to the
small number of red galaxies. The trends in the all- and blue galaxy subsamples are very similar at $z = 0.5$ as $z = 0$.
However, the red galaxy clustering in the stellar mass subsamples changes between the two redshifts. The two lower mass
bins for red galaxies cluster more strongly with HI at $z = 0.5$ than at $z = 0$, which provides some clues as to what
kinds of galaxies experience the most gas loss between those redshifts. Red galaxies in the lowest stellar mass bin
correlate notably more with HI at $z = 0.5$ than $z = 0$.
