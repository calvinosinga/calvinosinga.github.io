The redshift evolution of the blue (left), red (center),
and all (right) galaxy auto powers. The galaxy
auto power increases with time, which is the
expected evolution for power spectra.

However, the both of the colored auto powers decrease with time
between the latter two snapshots. This is also seen in the
cross-powers, but this removes the influence of the relationship
between galaxy color and HI, at least directly.
