Color-mass plane of galaxies at $z$ = 0, 0.5, and 1 for centrals, satellites
and both. The aspect of this plot that I wanted to emphasize was the time
evolution of the quenched centrals, particularly the lack of low-mass ones
at high redshift. This population clearly fills in quickly, indicating that
at more recent redshifts the quenching populations consists of considerably
smaller galaxies.
