								In the early Universe, dark matter collected

								changes the physics occurring in galaxies, playing a role

							<span class="keyword">Star formation</span> is a cornerstone in the grand narrative 
							of galaxy evolution.
							Cold, massive <span class="keyword">gas clumps</span> serve as the fuel for star formation,
							and as these galaxies mature they exhaust their gas reservoirs.
							In the video on the left, you can see this gas as the blue clumps.
							When these clumps are abundant, the star-formation rate is relatively
							large (SFR in the top). As the clumps dissipate towards the end of the 
							video, the SFR correspondingly falls. <br><br>
							
							Whether or not a galaxy is actively forming stars significantly affects
							its luminous properties. Massive stars tend to be blue, but also 
							have extremely short lives. If the galaxy is
							not actively forming stars, it cannot maintain a substantial population of
							blue stars, shifting the entire galaxy's color to redder colors. This process
							occurs relatively quickly
							such that galaxies largely belong to two groups. The first group
							is young, actively star-forming, <span class="keyword"> blue galaxies</span>, and the second is mature, passive, 
							<span class="keyword"> red galaxies</span>. The link between the state of star-formation and the properties of the 
							galaxy as a whole underscores the intricate relationship between star formation

							However, while astronomers have studied this dichotomy in
							galaxy evolution in detail, the many complicated mechanisms that influence the
							the star-formation and gas abundance in a galaxy remains an active field of study.

							As described in the first section, dark matter halos play a pivotal role in shaping the physical processes that dictate a galaxy's evolution. Massive halos, in particular, host a plethora of mechanisms that serve to dissipate the very gas necessary for nurturing new stars. <br><br>
							
							This is exemplified in the video on the left. Galaxies initially form in relative isolation, their star formation proceeding smoothly. However, a massive <span class="keyword">merger event</span> and subsequent chaotic mixing disperses the gas in this region, hampering the star-formation of the galaxies within them. Extrapolating from this example, we would then expect massive halos to typically host many red galaxies. The correlation between the star-formation state of galaxies and their host halos is just one step to understanding galaxy evolution.

								Simulations provide us a way to test our models and precisely understand the complicated physics responsible for galaxy evolution. I spearheaded a project with partners from UW, UMD and the Flatiron Institute to take advantage of a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation called <a class="link" href="https://www.tng-project.org/">IllustrisTNG</a>.
								We studied the spatial connection between blue and red galaxies and an ingredient for
								star-formation, neutral hydrogen gas, using their distributions to examine the spatial extent of the influence of environment (via the host halo mass) on the gas abundance and star-formation state of galaxies.
								We found that galaxies often have their gas content and star-formation altered beyond the virial radius of even the largest halos. In other words, <span class="keyword">galaxies are influenced by their environment even outside of massive halos</span>, which is surprising since intuitively one would expect galaxies to <em>start</em> losing their gas <em>inside</em> of the massive halos. <br><br>

								Another surprising result came from studying the time evolution of the clustering of galaxies and hydrogen. If you were to leave galaxies to their own devices, you would expect them to approach each other due to gravity, increasing their clustering. However, <span class="keyword">We found that all three of red galaxies, blue galaxies and hydrogen actually cluster <em>less</em> with time</span>, which is an entirely unexpected and novel. As it turns out, the changing galaxy demographics and gas reduction in the most clustered regions in the simulation are enough to reverse the expected evolution; for further explanation, please see the paper <a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16884">Osinga+23</a>. In upcoming work, we hope to understand the implications this has on efforts to map the large-scale structure of the Universe.
