								In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble famously observed that <a class="link" href="https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/measuring-the-universes-expansion-rate">the Universe was expanding</a>.
								Soon after, physicists attributed the expansion to the remnants of
								the Big Bang. Over a long enough period of time, they speculated that 
								the expansion would be slowed by gravity. This was a sensible conclusion,
								as gravity was the only known force that operated over such long distances. <br><br>
								
								In the 1990s, however, we discovered that the Universe's expansion was
								<span class="keyword">accelerating</span>, not slowing down. 
								Our current <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">
									Standard Model
								</a> of physics does not possess any forces that could drive the
								accelerating expansion; this indicates that our 
								understanding of physics is fundamentally incomplete.
								The mysterious force that is driving the accelerating expansion is
								called "dark energy". Uncovering the nature of dark energy is a
								critical step to a deeper understanding of the physical laws that
								govern our Universe. <br><br>
								
								The first step to solving dark energy is to precisely measure
								the expansion rate across the Universe's history. Recording
								dark energy's behavior establishes a foundation for future theories
								to decipher the mechanism behind it. The current timeline of 
								the Universe's history is shown on the left.

					Now that we understand the motivation for measuring the Universe's expansion 
					rate, how do we measure it? There are a few different ways, but fortunately the Universe
					provided a ruler for measuring recent expansion in the Universe. 
					How this ruler comes about is a fair bit 
					complicated, but the video above from CAASTRO provides a very useful visualization of this
					process. <br><br>

					The early Universe consisted of a fluid
					mixture of light and matter, which were coupled
					together because of the Universe's extremely
					high density or compactness. "Coupled" in this case
					indicates that the physical properties (in particular, 
					the temperature and pressure) of light and matter
					were linked by their constant interactions. 
					Any changes in one would also 
					occur in the other. During an event called 
					"<a class="link" href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/c/Cosmic_inflation.htm">inflation</a>", 
					quantum fluctuations perturb the light-matter fluid, forming ripples,
					almost as if someone dropped a bunch of pebbles into
					the fluid at the same time. These ripples all
					travel across the fluid at a constant speed, as is 
					shown in the first 30 seconds of the video, forming rings
					of approximately the same size.<br><br>
					
					However, the Universe's expansion eventually pulled
					the light and matter apart, destroying the fluid
					mixture. We still see light from this event coming from
					every direction! This is called the
					<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">Cosmic Microwave Background</a>,
					which we won't go into here. The ripples freeze and create
					nearly identical rings in the matter distribution.
					Galaxies then form inside of these rings. By
					studying the spatial distribution of galaxies statistically,  
					we can measure how the size of these rings change with time due to
					the Universe's expansion. <br><br>

								Galaxy surveys are expensive
								cheap alternative
								still in developmental stages
								Tianlai's goal is to demonstrate the potential of this
								technique to constrain cosmological parameters.
								
								The image on the left shows the array of radio telescopes I used to begin my research career with <a class="link" href="https://cmb.physics.wisc.edu/">Peter Timbie</a>,
								with the Milky Way overhead. These telescopes are a proof-of-concept
								for a technique called <span class="keyword">Intensity Mapping</span>, which intends to
								provide a cheap and efficient alternative to galaxy surveys, where
								observing each individual galaxy becomes an increasingly complicated
								challenge the further out we observe.
								To test this instrument, I built electromagnetic simulations
								of the array in order to predict and characterize its response
								to astronomical and test signals,
								which was used during this instrument's calibration phase
								<a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09351">(Zhang+21)</a>.
								I then used observational data to quantify variations in the response
								of the different dishes in the array
								<a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05946">(Wu+21)</a>.
