						I grew up near Milwaukee, Wisconsin where I took an interest in science
						at a young age. At that point, I thought all sciences were cool and
						struggled to pick just one to pursue as a career. <br /> <br />
						
						When I was 16, I was lucky enough to travel to
						Munich, Germany where I visited the Deutches Museum. There, the cosmology exhibit
						sparked my interest in astronomy &#8211 the ability to squeeze out so much
						knowledge when the Universe offered so little easily-obtained information was endlessly fascinating to me.

						I attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison
						for undergrad, where I majored in astronomy, physics, and mathematics with
						a minor in computer science. There I developed my interest in software
						development and data science, using my coding skills to build 
						electromagnetic simulations and analyze observational
						data for the Tianlai Pathfinder array. <br /><br />
						
						I now attend the University of
						Maryland - College Park, where I completed my master's in astronomy and
						am currently in my final year of the Ph. D. program. I'm building on
						my experiences developing new analysis software for state-of-the-art 
						computer simulations of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

							<h3>Music</h3>
							<p style="line-height: 1.35;">
								I've been heavily
								involved in music from an early age, playing violin since I
								was three years old. My mom is a string teacher, teaching me and my
								siblings (pictured above) as soon
								as we could fit an instrument into our hands.
								I was heavily involved in music growing up, whether it was through
								school or the <a href="https://myso.org/">Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra</a>.
								Although I'm not as involved in music as I used
								to be, I still find time to play and even picked up guitar for fun.
								If you're at all interested in my mom's work, check out 
								<a href="https://musicboxeducation.com/">her website</a>!

							<h3>Community Service</h3>
							<p style="line-height: 1.35;">
								I enjoy building up the astronomy community through leadership. In undergrad,
								I was president of the University Physical Society and an officer on the
								Astronomy Club. I ran events such as field trips to Fermilab (pictured above),
								and managed to grow UPS from around 50 students to more than 100, despite
								my year as president occuring during the start of the pandemic.
								I still take on leadership roles as the vice president of
								the astronomy graduate students.

							<h3>Verbal Communication Skills</h3>
							<p style="line-height: 1.35;">
								Early on in life, I seriously struggled to express myself verbally. I knew
								this was a skill that I needed, and sought out my high school's speech team
								as an avenue for improving it. For some perspective on how much I struggled,
								at speech competitions I received the worst score possible in every round I was in for
								my entire first year. But I persisted and practiced, eventually even earning
								some state and national bids in my later years. Turning this weakness into a 
								strength is one of my proudest accomplishments, and I occasionally have hosted
								workshops about what I've learned and techniques to help scientists that are
								not naturally gifted speakers.

							<h3>Hiking</h3>
							<p style="line-height: 1.35;">
								I'm not incredibly particular about how I stay active, since I
								generally enjoy most sports and outdoor activities.
								Recently, I've been taking a lot of hiking trips, although
								I also will occasionally play soccer, which was my sport of
								choice when I was younger.
