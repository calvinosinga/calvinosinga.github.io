                    Dark energy is currently one of the biggest mysteries in physics.
					No idea what it is, doesn't fit into our current understanding of
					physics.

					We know it must exist because the universe's expansion is 
					accelerating, and there must be something causing it.

					Difficult to figure out what it is without understanding how it
					behaves. Need to measure the expansion history of the universe.
					As we understand it, pictured to the left.

                        Early Universe, matter and photon mixture in
						"primordial fluid"

						Similar to any fluid, possesses density waves.
						"Ripples"/sound waves.

						Matter and photons are pulled apart as universe expands,
						still see photons from this event.

                        Indicate that extracting cosmology from hydrogen maps may be
                        a tougher analytical challenge than initially anticipated,
                        but certainly one that is not insurmountable.
