                    In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble famously observed that <a href="https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/measuring-the-universes-expansion-rate">the Universe was expanding</a>.
					At the time, physicists attributed the expansion to the remnants of
					the Big Bang. Over a long enough period of time, they speculated that 
					the expansion would be slowed by gravity. This was a sensible conclusion,
					as gravity was the only force that operated over such long distances. <br><br>
					
					In the 1990s, however, we discovered that the Universe's expansion was
					<em>accelerating</em>, not slowing down. 
					Our current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">
						Standard Model
					</a> of physics does not possess any forces that could drive the
					accelerating expansion; this indicates that our 
					understanding of physics is fundamentally incomplete.
					The mysterious force that is driving the accelerating expansion is
					called "dark energy". Uncovering the nature of dark energy is a
					critical step to a deeper understanding of the physical laws that
					govern our Universe. <br><br>
					
					The first step to solving dark energy is to precisely measure
					the expansion rate across the Universe's history. Recording
					dark energy's behavior establishes a foundation for future theories
					to decipher the mechanism behind it. The current timeline of 
					the Universe's history is shown on the left.

                        Now that we understand the motivation for measuring the Universe's expansion 
						rate, how do we measure it? Fortunately, the Universe has provided us a ruler. 
						How this ruler comes about is a fair bit 
						complicated, but the video above from CAASTRO provides a very useful visualization of this
						process. <br><br>

						The early Universe consisted of a fluid
						mixture of light and matter, which were coupled
						together because of the Universe's extremely
						high density or compactness. "Coupled" in this case
						indicates that the physical properties (in particular, 
						the temperature and pressure) of light and matter
						were linked together by their constant interactions. 
						Any changes in one would also 
						occur in the other. Similar to other fluids like water or air, ripples 
						travel across the fluid at a constant speed, as is 
						shown in the first 30 seconds of the video. <br><br>
						
						However, the Universe's expansion eventually pulled
						the light and matter apart, destroying the fluid
						mixture. We still see light from this event coming from
						every direction! This is called the
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">Cosmic Microwave Background</a>,
						which we won't go into here. The ripples freeze and create
						similarly sized rings in the matter distribution.
						Galaxies then form inside of these rings, allowing us to 
						measure how the size of these rings change with time due to
						the Universe's expansion. <br><br>
